### The Process:

Nothing you're about to do is in any way hard, so unless you're trying to break something you don't have anything to worry about. Doing all of these mods is a simple but time consuming process; for someone who has no prior experience I would allot at least an hour to an hour and a half to get everything done.The general procedure is as follows:

1. ###### Fully disassemble keyboard
  
  This is fairly straightforward. Pull all the caps off with the included tool, give extra care to the stabilized keys [1]. They are : ``SPACE, ENTER, BACKSPACE, LSHIFT, RSHIFT`` on a TKL (Ten-key-less) keyboard.
  
2. ###### Clip & lube stabilizers
  
  Basically just follow the instructions inlink [4]. The process is easy and straightforward, you just need to repeat it several times.
  
3. ###### Reinstall stabilizers and add band-aids to PCB
  
  Putting the stabilizers back in the plate will help ensure you get the band-aids placed in the right spot.
  
4. ###### Install case foam and reassemble case
  
  Exploded the CTRL will stack as follows: top case > top foam > PCB > bottom foam > acrylic ring > bottom case. Pretty straightforward stuff, but let me know if you have any questions.
  
5. ###### Reinstall switches and caps on stabilized keys only
  
  Don't fully reassemble the keyboard just yet, we need to make sure the stabilized keys are good to go; just in case something needs tweaking.
  
6. ###### Make sure the stabilized keys feel good and the their presses register
  
  Per previous step. We just want to make sure the stabilized keys feel right and still function properly. I've improperly installed/modified stabilizers before and the keys are sluggish to return, if at all, or have a noticable resistance to them. The lube is here to do the opposite, among other things.
  
7. ###### Reinstall remaining switches\* and caps once satisfied
  
  You should just be able to push the switches back in, make sure none of the switch pins are bent before doing so though. If you're upgrading to Phoenix switches, see the asterisk at the document's foot.
  
8. ###### Test all keys and tweak as needed
  
  Go to [5] and make sure every key registers properly. Any that don't likely went in funny and got a bent pin, just pop it back out and straight the pin with some tweezers or needle-nose pliers. Then reinstall and try again until it's all good.

### \* Upgrading to Phoenix switches

Phoenix switches come from the factory configured for PCB mount installation instead of plate mount. Many newer boards support both so it's not a big deal, but a lot are still designed for one or the other. You can convert PCB to plate mount easily, but not vice versa. PCB mount switches have two extra small plastic legs on either side of the center post, these need to be removed completely for installation into a plate-mount-only PCB such as the CTRL's. This can easily be done with a pair of flush cutters, or non-curved nail clippers if you don't mind the added wear.
